# Heart-Disease-Classification
Using R to run Factor Analysis, LASSO Regression, Full Technical Report

This project utilized techniques of Factor Analysis and LASSO Regression in R in order to predict classification of a Heart disease diagnosis. There were three main routes of analysis:
1. Create a LASSO logistic regression model for prediction
2. Examine Factor Analysis to understand latent factors
3. Use the Factor Scores to create a comparable LASSO logistic regression model

This repository has all code as well as a slideshow presentation and full technical report that contain all results, interpretations and takeaways from this project
